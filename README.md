# -Real-Time-Hand-Detection-using-Streamlit-and-MediaPipe
This project is a real-time hand detection web app built using Streamlit, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It allows users to detect hands live via webcam directly in the browser using WebRTC.The app processes each video frame to identify hand landmarks and visualize them in real time.

🚀 Features
📷 Real-time webcam streaming using streamlit-webrtc
✋ Hand detection and landmark tracking powered by MediaPipe
⚡ Fast and lightweight interface with Streamlit
🧠 Easily extendable for gesture recognition, finger counting, or sign language interpretation
